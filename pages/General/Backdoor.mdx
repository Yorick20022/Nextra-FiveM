### What is a backdoor?

A backdoor in the context of FiveM (or any software) is like a secret hidden entrance into a system. Imagine you have a house with a locked front door, but someone secretly installs a hidden door that only they know about. This hidden door allows them to get into your house whenever they want, without you knowing.

### Why am I here?

You are here because your server keeps crashing while you have no clue why this happens. I hate to break it to you, but your server is infected with a backdoor.

### How could this have happened??

The cause of this problem is installing leaked resources, these resources contain malware.

### Locate the backdoor

<Steps>

### Browse to your resources folder
1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. In the top left click "File"
3. Click "Open Folder"
4. Browse to your resources folder and open this entire folder in Visual Studio Code.

### Look for the backdoor

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + F` on your keyboard, a textbox should now appear where you write the following:
```js
const _ = Buffer.from
```

### The result

If your results look like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/FKeO27usW05q.png"}/>, that means that there is a backdoor in your server.
</Steps>

### What do I do now???

Because your Operating System is now infected with malware, the only solution is to reset the entire Operating System.

### How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Like mentioned before, the only reason you have this backdoor in your server is because someone, either you or a developer, installed leaked resources into your server. The only place where you should get your resources from is from [the Cfx forums](https://forum.cfx.re/) and Tebex stores.

<Callout type="warning">
After resetting your entire OS, you can use your old resources just fine BUT make sure they are safe and do not contain the backdoor.
