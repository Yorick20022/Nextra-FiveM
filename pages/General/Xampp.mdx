# Xampp

### Common errors

First of all I will start off by addressing the most common issue that Xampp Control Panel faces:

<details>
<summary>MySQL shutdown unexpectedly</summary>
- In case you have ever seen this error:
```
11:02:20  [mysql]   Error: MySQL shutdown unexpectedly.
11:02:20  [mysql]   This may be due to a blocked port, missing dependencies, 
11:02:20  [mysql]   improper privileges, a crash, or a shutdown by another method.
11:02:20  [mysql]   Press the Logs button to view error logs and check
11:02:20  [mysql]   the Windows Event Viewer for more clues
11:02:20  [mysql]   If you need more help, copy and post this
11:02:20  [mysql]   entire log window on the forums
```
- Despite your efforts to fix the issue, the error just won't go away.. Extremely frustrating.
- Anyways, worry no longer because with this one simple trick we can solve all your Xampp issues.. Forever!

### Making a database back-up

<Callout>
First of all it's very important to make a back-up of your database before we delete this pile of shit for once and for all from our PC's
</Callout>

1. Search on Google how to make an export of the SQL file from the database. This can vary per software you use to manage your database.
2. Put the exported SQL file in a location that you can remember such as your `Desktop`
3. Now that we have successfully made a back-up of our database, it's time to continue to the next part.

### Getting rid of Xampp forever

1. On your keyboard, press the key combination `Windows + R` like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/jLQL15MfW5OY.png"}/>.
2. In the box that pops up, you type `appwiz.cpl`, like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/aAvJAD0zaUVZ.png"}/>. Click "OK" or press `Enter`
3. In all the apps that you find here, look for "XAMPP".
4. Once you have located the app, right click it and select "Uninstall/change", if it asks you to select yes or no, select yes.
5. It should now ask you to select yes or no <LinkButton text={"here"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/UcOKuIbpS1nc.png"}/>, select Yes. If it asks you to delete the `htdocs` folder, select Yes as well.
