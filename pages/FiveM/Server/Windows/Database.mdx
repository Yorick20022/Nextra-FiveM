# Database

In this guide I will be explaining how to install MariaDB in combination with HeidiSQL to manage your server's database.

## MariaDB
<Steps>
### Download MariaDB

- Download MariaDB from [the official website](https://mariadb.org/download)
- Select MariaDB Server Version **11.4.4**
- Select "Windows" as "Operating System"
- The website should now look like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/rlpc2WShqOYo.png"}/>
- Leave the "mirror" default
- Press "Download"

### Install MariaDB

Now that we have installed the MSI file, its time to install the application.
- Run the MSI file
- Press next
- Tick the box for License Agreement and press next
- Leave the settings default, press next
- You can either choose to untick the box to continue without a password or create a password, that is up to you. If you have done that press Next again
- Leave all the settings default and press next
- Press "Install"
- If your computer asks you "Do you want this app to make changes to your device" click "Yes".
- Once that is done you should be able to click "Finish".
- To make sure that MariaDB is properly installed, we will go to <LinkButton text={"services.msc"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/BHWxt6U1YF43.png"}/> and look for "MariaDB"
- If you followed all these steps, MariaDB should be present in the services like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://r2.fivemanage.com/image/lLGjkENKvSJB.png"}/>
</Steps>

## HeidiSQL

HeidiSQL is used to view and manage the database.

## Optional

### Connect to the server and create a database
- Open HeidiSQL once the installation is complete
- In the bottom left, click on "New"
- Now enter the connection details as follows:
  - Hostname / IP: If you installed MariaDB on the same machine as HeidiSQL, leave it as `127.0.0.1`. If not, enter the public IP of the machine where MariaDB is installed (Port Forwarding needed) click [here](https://docs.yorick.gg/FiveM/Server/Windows/Portforwarding) to learn how to portforward.
  - User: Leave as `root`
- Press "Open"
- Right click the server in the top left (usually Unnamed) and press "Create new -> Database"
- Enter the name of the database and press "OK"

### Add the database to your FiveM server
- Open your server.cfg file
- Add one of the following lines to the file (above `ensure oxmysql`):
```cfg
set mysql_connection_string "mysql://root:PASSWORD@localhost:3306/DATABASE_NAME"
```
```cfg
set mysql_connection_string "user=root;password=PASSWORD;host=localhost;port=3306;database=DATABASE_NAME"
```
- Replace `PASSWORD` with the password you set during the MariaDB installation and `DATABASE_NAME` with the name of the database you created in HeidiSQL
- Save the file and restart your server
