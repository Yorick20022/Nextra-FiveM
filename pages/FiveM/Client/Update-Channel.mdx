# Change FiveM channel

This guide will show you how to change the update channel in your FiveM client.

### What does "Update Channel" mean?

Basically "Update Channel" just means the client version you are using at that moment.

FiveM consists of 3 update channels:
- Release
- Beta
- Unstable (Canary)

### Change channels

- In the top right corner of your FiveM you will see this gear icon, click it.
- Now there's 3 options, Account, interface and Game. Click the Game option.
- At the top there is a section called "Update Channel". Select the one that you want to use.
- You will now see that you have to restart FiveM for the change to be applied.

<Callout type="info">
Usually you would use the "Release" channel. Only change the channel if you know what you are doing!
